## Description

An mp3/wav player that reads the song from a sd card and plays it on a bluetooth speaker. The mp3 
player also has a potentiometer that is used to change the volume, a play/pause button and skip 
song and backwards buttons. 
## Motivation

I chose this project because I think an mp3 bluetooth player that has the songs stored offline can be helpful when there is no internet access.
## Architecture 
### Raspberry Pi Pico 2W

Acts as the main microcontroller.

Connected to various GPIOs for peripherals like buttons, SD card, and LED.

### SD Card Reader

Connected via SPI:

CS, SCK, MOSI, MISO

For reading audio or data files.

### MH-M28 Bluetooth Audio Module 

Handles audio output over Bluetooth.

Connected to 5V, GND, and analog outputs (L, R).

Includes AGND for audio ground isolation.

Volume control via potentiometer.

### Potentiometer 

Connected to the audio module for analog volume control.

### Push Buttons (SW1, SW2, SW3)

Functions:

SW1: Pause/Play

SW2: Next Song

SW3: Previous Song

Connected to GPIOs of the RP2040.

### LED Indicator 

LED with a current-limiting resistor (220Î©).

Used for indicating if the song is paused or playing.
